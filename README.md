# Claude AGENTS

A wrapper for the Claude CLI that can run in AGENTS mode (ignoring CLAUDE.md and using AGENTS.md) OR CLAUDE mode (standard Claude behavior).

## What's New üéâ

- Switch between CLAUDE and AGENTS modes
- Use the handy `cl` bash wrapper for quick mode switching
- Mode preference is saved between sessions
- **NEW**: Auto-start Claude after mode switch

## Installation

```bash
# Install
npm install -g claude-agents-md
```

The first time you run `claude-agents-md`, you will be presented with a consent prompt explaining the security implications. You must explicitly agree to continue.

Your consent choice is remembered for future runs.

### Using command-line flags

```bash
# Run in CLAUDE mode (normal Claude CLI behavior)
claude-agents-md --claude
claude-agents-md --no-agents

# Run in AGENTS mode (default)
claude-agents-md
```

### Using mode commands

```bash
# Switch to AGENTS mode
claude-agents-md mode agents

# Switch to CLAUDE mode
claude-agents-md mode claude

# Check current mode
claude-agents-md mode
```

### Using the cl wrapper script (Recommended!)

For even easier mode management, use the included `cl` bash wrapper:

```bash
# Install globally during npm install
npm install -g claude-agents-md

# Or copy manually to your PATH
cp node_modules/claude-agents-md/bin/cl /usr/local/bin/cl
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cl

# Now you can use:
cl /YON      # Switch to AGENTS mode AND start Claude
cl /YOFF     # Switch to CLAUDE mode AND start Claude
cl /STATUS   # Show current mode (without starting Claude)
cl /HELP     # Show help

# Run Claude in current mode
cl "write a hello world function"

# Switch mode and run with command
cl /YON "create a web server"
```

Mode preference is saved in `~/.claude_agents_state` and persists between sessions.

## Visual Mode Indicators

The tool now shows clear visual indicators of which mode you're in:

- **AGENTS Mode**: `[AGENTS]` prefix in yellow üî•
- **CLAUDE Mode**: `[CLAUDE]` prefix in cyan üõ°Ô∏è

## Usage

```bash
claude-agents-md [options]
```

All arguments and options are passed directly to the Claude CLI.

This wrapper in AGENTS mode:
1. Checks for and automatically installs updates to the Claude package
2. Displays "üî• AGENTS MODE ACTIVATED üî•" warning in yellow text
3. Creates a modified copy of the Claude CLI code to use AGENTS.md
4. Leaves the original Claude CLI file untouched (won't affect your normal `claude` command)

In CLAUDE mode, it simply runs the original Claude CLI without modifications.

## Why?

You want to use AGENTS.md

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues, you can run with debug output:

```bash
DEBUG=1 claude-agents-md
```

This will show additional information about:
- Claude package update checks
- Current and latest available versions
- When updates are being installed
- Modifications being made to the CLI file

## Auto-Update Feature

Claude AGENTS automatically checks for updates to the Claude package each time it runs:

1. When you run `claude-agents-md`, it checks for the latest version of `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` on npm
2. If your installed version is outdated, it will:
   - Update your package.json with the latest version
   - Run npm install to get the newest version
   - Notify you that an update was applied
3. This ensures you're always using the latest Claude CLI features
